Prefinery .NET API
==================
 
An assembly which makes it easy to integrate Prefinery into your ASP.NET website.
 
Prefinery (http://www.prefinery.com) helps you launch a private beta in minutes.
Prefinery collects email addresses, generates invitation codes, and sends
invitations for your web beta. Your customers never leave your site and
e-mail invitations are sent from your address.
 
 
Installation
============

Build Compulsivio.Prefinery.dll and add it to your website project's references.
It's really that simple.


Configuration
=============

None, yet... :(

Web.config configuration is planned.


Documentation
=============

Create a PrefineryCore object. It uses the repository pattern (kinda) for
managing Tester objects. Beware of thrown exceptions.

Real docs are, again, planned. Until then, read the code (the goggles do
nothing).
